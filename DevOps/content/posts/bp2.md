# CS-EJ4101 Introduction to DevOps 059

# Learned

Too early to say what I have learned but few things below.

- Have been using GitHub but never used the github pages so learned how to use it.
- Learned the basics of DevOps thru' the online course link provided.

Learning is never ending. Ok, having said that now go grab coffee and begin conversation with friends. Share new ideas and make try make complex things simple.

```python
s = "Happy Learning but remember its never EnDiNg."
print s
```
